# aqbanking2json

AqBanking2JSON is a command-line tool that converts AqBanking output files into JSON format.
I have no idea if this is useful to anyone else, but I needed it for a project.

## Development

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.1. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
